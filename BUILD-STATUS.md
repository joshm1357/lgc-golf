# Build status

Live app: https://joshm1357.github.io/lgc-golf/
Safe copy of the first working version (Stage 1 only): branch `ambrose-ready`.
Database: Supabase project `lgc-golf` (Sydney), migrations in `supabase/migrations/`.

## Done
- **Database:** full data model for all stages, Row Level Security, PIN-checked join/admin, handicap guard
  (only admin or Tribunal can change a handicap; every change logged), birdie auto-posts, Tribunal functions,
  photo bucket, realtime. Checked with an SQL walk-through (join, admin, scoring, guard, Tribunal verdict).
- **Scoring maths** (`src/lib/scoring.js`, `projection.js`, `board.js`) with 18 tests.
- **Stage 1:** join with group PIN, profile setup with selfie, admin (trips, courses, players, rounds, teams,
  trophies, honour board, PINs, paper-card results), score entry with offline queue, live leaderboard with
  projected finish + win %, scorecards, player profiles with history.
- **Stage 2:** feed (photos, comments, reactions, auto-posts), side comps (closest to pin / longest drive with
  map pins, photos, GPS tee), where's-everyone map (opt-in GPS + "on hole X" from scores).
- **Stage 3:** trophies (BD = Stableford total; Ambrose trophy) with projection, honour board seeded from the
  real trophy, Handicap Tribunal (lodge, evidence, defence, vote, chair overrule, verdict applies handicap),
  courses page.

## Known limits
- GPS distances are approximate (±5–10 m); closest-to-pin distance is typed in.
- Location sharing only works while the app is open.
- Supabase free plan pauses after 7 days without use — restore it from the dashboard before the next trip.

## Later
- Dinner awards voting, fines.
