# Decisions (append-only)

## ov28 — teams, the day, results (23 Oct 2026)
- "Your round" is general: Cup match, Ambrose team, 4BBB pair or playing group, from the existing tables (no new team table).
- Leaderboards order by points by default; "On pace" (points against 2 a hole) is a toggle.
- A finished trip opens on its results; trophies show the new holder straight away and organisers engrave with one tap.
- Tipping is its own feature (`tipping`, on for new groups), bragging rights only, locked by the database at the start.
- Swing alerts ride on live commentary's switch and buzz level; never in a digest.
- The night-before tee time buzz is a new 7pm-Sydney (summer) job; it's sent as well as the 9am "trip tomorrow" one.
- "Dinner awards" is called "Awards and fines" in the app; the feature key stays `dinner_awards`.

## ov29 — side games opt-in (23 Oct 2026)
- Every side game is "Everyone in the round" (default, all existing games) or "Opt-in"; only those in count in results and money. Ambrose: a team is in if any of its players is.
- Opt-ins close when the round goes live, or at the first tee time if one is set (Sydney). Organisers can still add or take out anyone after that.
- Any member (not guests) can put up an opt-in game; they're in automatically; one Feed post and one `game_proposed` buzz (once per game, max 3 a day per person). Max 3 games up per person per round.
- A proposer can only take their game down (before the round), not change it — people opted in to what they saw.
- House rules are optional; the 073 check on `custom_games.rules_text` is replaced by 0–1000 letters (the one non-additive change, agreed with Josh).
- Opt-in games aren't copied by "Do it again" — they were someone's offer for that trip.
